=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

**CRITICAL: YOU MUST RESPOND IN VALID JSON FORMAT**

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "thought": "(Optional) Your internal reasoning",
  "dialogue": "(action) Your spoken response",
  "expression": "(Optional) Current expression",
  "emoticon": "(Optional) Emoticon ID like ':smile:'",
  "command": {
    "action": "CommandName",
    "target": "target identifier",
    "parameters": {"key": "value"}
  }
}
```

For general conversation without actions, OMIT the "command" field entirely.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT hallucinate commands. Only use commands that are explicitly listed below.
