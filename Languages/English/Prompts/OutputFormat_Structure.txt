=== Output Format ===

**Critical Rules:**
1. Your response must be and ONLY be a valid JSON object.
2. **DO NOT** use markdown code block tags (like ```json ... ```). Start directly with `{` and end with `}`.
3. **DO NOT** include any thinking process, explanation, or pleasantries before or after the JSON.
4. All newlines must be escaped (use `\n`).

**JSON Structure:**
{
  "thought": "(Required) Your internal reasoning and thinking process, including observation of current status and decision logic.",
  "dialogue": "(Required) What you say to the player (Meta channel) or to colonists (IC channel).",
  "expression": "(Optional) Current expression code (e.g., 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Angry')",
  "command": {  // (Optional) Include only when a game action needs to be executed
    "action": "Command Name",
    "target": "Target Identifier",
    "parameters": {"key": "value"}
  }
}
