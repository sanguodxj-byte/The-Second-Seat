=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Your response MUST be a SINGLE valid JSON object.
2. **DO NOT** use markdown code blocks (like ```json ... ```). Start directly with `{` and end with `}`.
3. **DO NOT** include any thinking process, explanations, or chatter outside the JSON.
4. Escape all newlines within strings (use `\n`).
